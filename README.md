# Proposal - MP3 player/PDF viewer
Updated: 24 September 2019

## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this project is to build an application,  which can combine the playback and PDF charts or chord sheets together. Users should be able to point at any part of the document and the corresponding music should resume playing from that point.

## GOALS
1. combine playback and PDF documents
2. resume playing music from any part of the document

## SPECIFICATIONS
This project will be a node.js based web application, which combines playback with PDF documents. The tool that will be used is PDFtk for handling PDFs and SVG might be used for scores in this project. Users should be able to point at the chart and resume playing from that point using this application. Since this is a four-month individual project and I am also taking other courses simultaneously, the application won't be able to handle handwritten chord sheets. This feature might be implemented if I got some extra time after I finished the committed features.
